- User awareness training
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)


## 2. Pretexting

Pretexting involves creating a fake scenario or identity to gain the victim’s trust and extract information.

Impact:
- Identity theft
- Unauthorized data access

Prevention:
- Verification procedures
- Strict information-sharing policies


## 3. Baiting

Baiting uses physical media (like infected USB drives) or fake downloads to lure victims into installing malware.

Impact:
- Malware infection
- System compromise

Prevention:
- Disable autorun
- Security awareness training


## Conclusion

Humans are often the weakest link in cybersecurity.
Regular awareness training and strict verification processes are essential to prevent social engineering attacks.
