# Task 4 - Research Report on Common Network Security Threats

## 1. Denial of Service (DoS) Attack

A Denial of Service attack floods a server or network with excessive traffic, making it unavailable to legitimate users.

Impact:
- Website downtime
- Financial loss
- Service disruption

Prevention:
- Firewalls
- Rate limiting
- DDoS protection services


## 2. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack

A Man-in-the-Middle attack occurs when an attacker secretly intercepts communication between two parties.

Impact:
- Data theft
- Credential compromise
- Session hijacking

Prevention:
- Use HTTPS
- Use VPN
- Avoid public unsecured Wi-Fi


## 3. Spoofing Attack

Spoofing involves pretending to be a trusted source to gain unauthorized access.

Types:
- IP Spoofing
- Email Spoofing
- ARP Spoofing

Prevention:
- Email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- Network monitoring
- Packet filtering


## Conclusion

Network security threats exploit weak configurations and poor security practices.
Proper monitoring and updated security measures are essential to protect systems.
